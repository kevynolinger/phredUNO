# phredUNO
This is an implementation of the widley popular game "UNO", first introduced in 1971. phredUNO may vary from the original game rules because this is an own interpretation of the game. It is part of a school project.

The game is seperated in 2 components: the server and the client(s). You can find more precise and specific information in the subfolder(s) of each component.
